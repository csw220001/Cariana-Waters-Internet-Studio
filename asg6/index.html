	<h1>Six Thinking Hats Discussion</h1>
	
	<h2 class="summary">Summary</h2>
	<p>Below is a summary of each hat's discussion:</p>
	
	<h3>White Hat</h3>
	<p>We have the information about what the website is and potential indie projects we could host on the website. 
		We need to know how the information is going to be recorded and uploaded, <br> what defines an independent creator, 
		what kind of media will be hosted here, and how it is monetized.
		Most of this we can figure out by decision, but when it comes to the definition of an <br> independent creator, 
		that will be a combination of research and decision.</p>
	
	<h3>Red Hat</h3>
	<p>We are feeling hopeful and positive about the project. Our intuition says that it'll be a lot of reasearch to find 
		projects to host on the site. As a whole, feelings range from some anxiety <br> towards scope to inspiration at the 
		good it could do.</p>
	
	<h3>Black Hat</h3>
	<p>Potential problems include that the scope of this project may be too large for this class; the success of independent 
		media is luck based, and so this website may not help so much; and <br> the scope of moderation of appropriateness of 
		posted content may be too large.</p>
	
	<h3>Yellow Hat</h3>
	<p>This website has potential to be a great resource and is within the scope of possibility, and the masses are likely 
		to appreciate and lift up a website like this. Even just sifting out <br> corporate media will give smaller creators 
		a better chance. This project has value because it uplifts the voices of independent creators as well as connects 
		different regions through the <br> sharing of art. Research will make this project work. Design and easy to use UI 
		will be key in attracting users.</p>
	
	<h3>Green Hat</h3>
	<p>Instead of purely being a website where creators can post their work, maybe the admin team (me) can manually 
		research and add pages for already-known indie projects. To solve the <br> black hat problems we need employees 
		in order to run a website at the ideal scale.</p>
	
	<h3>Blue Hat</h3>
	<p>The subject of this discussion is my website idea. Our goal is to promote indie projects. Self check-in and reminders 
		of the goal will keep us on track. The white hat cleared up questions, <br> the red hat was good morale as we looked at 
		and listed the positives, the black hat felt necessary but upsetting to consider, the yellow hat felt as though 
		it echoed red and white, and <br> the green hat was difficult but provided useful insights.</p>

	<h2>Changes</h2>
	<p>I plan for the website to be a mix of admin-created and creator-created pages showcasing works of indie media, with the 
		added option for donations to keep the website (financially) <br> worth running. Additionally, if I continue to pursue this 
		website following this class, I may look forward to gathering a team of volunteers to help me maintain and moderate it.
		Other than <br> these points, nothing much has changed with my project excepting the need for more research.</p>
