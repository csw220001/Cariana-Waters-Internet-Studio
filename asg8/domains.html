        <h1>Domain Name Ideas</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>wondersoftheworld.net</li>
            <li>manywonders.org</li>
            <li>findindie.org</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>My neighbor and I discussed my three ideas after checking to make sure they were available. We concluded a few things. For one, wondersoftheworld is hard to read. It looks like Wonder-Softhe-World manywonders looks good, reads clearly, and is a nice domain name. Findindie is the best though. Not only is it easy to read and remember, but it also tells the user exactly what the site is for.</p>
        <h2>Decision</h2>
        <p>Based on our discussion, I've decided to move forward with findindie.org, as I think it is the clearest and easiest to remember. It details the mission of my website and being easy to remember will make it more easily accessible to users.</p>
