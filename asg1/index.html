	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<h2>Part 2</h2>
	<p>I learned three things from my reading material:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Website design should be deliberate and planned so it can be compatible with future technological developments.</li>
		<li>New ideas are important for the progression of the web space.</li>
		<li>The web is evolving towards decentralization.</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Part 3</h2>
	<p>For my final project I'd like to create a website that promotes indepentent works such as indie animated shows, indie games, and self-published books. <br>
	The website will be a platform where these works will come to light easier and perhaps garner a greater audience than they might otherwise find in the <br>
	seas of media that are Youtube, Steam, and Tiktok. The site will have the ability to allow creators to upload a preview or trailer of their work, as well <br>
	as links to it, and allow users to filter media by medium. I want there to be two feeds: one feed of the most popular or trending pieces of independent <br>
	media, and another that is purely random and refreshes with the page.</p>
