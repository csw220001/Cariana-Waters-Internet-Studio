    <h2>Structured Content and Semantic HTML</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?<br>
            Structured content is kind of the goal of semantic HTML. Structured content is ease of human viewing of information, while semantic HTML is meant to be read not only by humans but also by the algorithms, <br>
            such as algorithms trying to sort through that content to provide it to humans.<br><br></li>
        <li>How do they work together?<br>
            Algorithms have more trouble understanding things than humans do. They don't have intuition in the same way we do, it has to be coded into them. Algorithms do a lot behind the scenes working to turn HTML <br>
            into structured content for humans to digest. Semantic HTML helps them do that. Semantic HTML helps algorithms create structured content and structured content helps semantic HTML be as well formatted <br>
            and readable as possible.<br><br></li>
        <li>Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages?<br>
            Ultimately it all comes down to ease of consumption. The more structured content and semantic HTML you have, the easier humans and algorithms alike will be able to digest it. Ease of consumption is ease <br>
            of information.</li>

    <h2>Reading Questions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Denise Jacobs argues that we all have a troll-like inner critic. Of the methods she identifies to banish this troll, which would be most successful for you? Why?<br>
            I've found that 'seeking the truth' has been most helpful for me in banishing my inner critic. My inner critic tends to catastrophize and make something big out of something small. It cares so much about <br>
            what people think, but in reality the people whose opinions it cares most about are typically unkind and uninformed and not worth considering.<br><br></li>
        <li>In David McRaney's article, what is "hyperbolic discounting"? List one method McRaney identifies to counteract hyperbolic discounting. Which would work best for you?<br>
            "Hyperbolic discounting" is the process in which we become more rational when we are forced to wait. It means that we are least rational at the beginning of a waiting period and seek instant gratification.<br>
            McRaney identifies making plans that force your future self to commit as a method of counteracting hyperbolic discounting, and it is this one that I think would work best for me.<br><br></li>
        <li>Critical Web Design addresses four types of power in networks. As you learn web publishing fundamentals, what network-making power do you (or don't you) have as the creator and publisher of your work?<br>
            Answer.</li>
