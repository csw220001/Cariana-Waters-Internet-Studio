	<h1>Jhariah Clare</h1>
	<img src="img/jhariah-clare.jpg">
	<p>Jhariah Clare is an independent musician who aptly describes his musical style as "No Genre, All Drama."</p>
	<h2>Why I love Jhariah<h2>
	<h3>I love Jhariah's raw, dramatic energy as well as his unique musical style. So much of his music not only speaks to me on a deep emotional level, but also just resonates with me musically. <br>
	Jhariah is a true creative, not only musically but also artistically. Jhariah's music speaks to the theater kid, the depressed middle schooler, and the self-assured adult all at once. His music <br>
	is truly just "Oops, all bangers."</h3>
