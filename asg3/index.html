    <ol>
        <li>From the Do's and Don'ts of Web Design, provide a link to an example of a violation of number 6 (clickable elements are not obvious).<br>
            At <a href="https://www.suzannecollinsbooks.com/" target="_blank">www.suzannecollinsbooks.com</a> it is not immediately clear that most (though not all) orange text is clickable.<br><br></li>
        <li>From the Better User Experience Through Storytelling Articles: How can framing your project in a story format help you refine your ideas? <br>
            Write a paragraph explanation.<br>
            Framing your project in a story format helps to make it more human and easily digestible, as well as emotionally resonant. People can better <br>
            understand a story than they can understand an outline or points of data. A story can simplify complex ideas into something anyone can <br>
            understand. This also makes ideas easier to develop. Furthermore, once your project idea is simplified into a story format, it's easy to pitch.<br><br></li>
        <li>From Meet Your Type: A Field Guide to Love and Typography: What are different ways to establish hierarchy (or emphasis) in typography design? <br>
            Provide a link to a good example of hierarchy.<br>
            Having a stand-out display face and a simple, easy-to-read text face is definitely a good way to get started on your hierarchy. Choosing one <br>
            serif and one sans serif is another good way to differentiate your fonts in the hierarchy. Thickness variation is a third method.<br>
