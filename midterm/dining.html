                    <p>Sugar-Top Stop is a small, isolated inn/restaurant at the east entrance of the Gumdrop Mountains' main trail. A warm respite from the chill of the mountain pass. It's a relatively new location, having been funded in part by the Queen herself in an effort to populate the mountains. Their world-famous gumdrop gumbo is to die for according to Queen Merry, who is a known foodie.</p>
