            <h2>Design Statement</h2>
            <h6 class="statement">Aesthetic</h6>
            <p class="statement">For Karamela's travel page I wanted something simple and pleasant; something sweet like the location. Pink seemed like the perfect main color. After all, it's close to red and white, which are the main colors of Karamela's queen. The other accent colors, purple and blue, also felt very candy-like, which is why I chose them. I wanted everything to be round and friendly on this site, with the exception of the old map: a sign of darker times.</p>
            <h6 class="statement">Fonts</h6>
            <p class="statement">I chose two sans-serif fonts that I thought worked well together because to me serif has a sort of regality that Karamela just doesn't have. Even its queen is a very humble woman, with more softness to her demeanor than nobility. Overall, I thought sans-serif would be more welcoming.</p>
            <h6 class="statement">Intentions</h6>
            <p class="statement">Overall I wanted to evoke a sense of comfort and magic in this website. I wanted it to have an air of coziness and excitement all in one cute package. It's a simple site, but so is Karamela! I worry it may be simple to the point of emptiness, but I just don't know how to fill it. As Karamela is a world born in the mind of my friends and I, I don't have many images to show, so I had to make do and try to fill it with text and interesting shapes.</p>
